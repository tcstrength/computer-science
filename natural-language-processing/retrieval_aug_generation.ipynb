    "### Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "Retrieval augmented generation of RAG for short is a framework to combine elements of both retrieval-based and generation-based models in NLP. It aims to leverage the strengths of both approaches to improve the quality and relevance of the response. \n",
    "\n",
    "The generation-based approach such as sequence-to-sequence has a limitation that it can only learn from the training data used to train the model e.g. the model does not have specific domains such as health or insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG implementation can help solving the issue by providing the context to the LLM where the context is retrieved based on the \"query\" or user input question. There will be a Vector Store is used for searching the relevant contents, the contents may be company internal documents, or domain documents. The prompt is then modified to use the contents and answer to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of what RAG is:\n",
    "![Retrieval Augmented Generation](images/rag.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "RAG basically has 3 main components: Text Embedding, Vector Store and LLM. The Text Embedding takes responsibility to generate embeddings from text and those embeddings are comparable. The Vector Store stores embeddings and raw texts at the same time and can perform similarity search (consine similiarity, euclidean distance, ...). The LLM generates response from given __context__ and __question__ from user as input.\n",
