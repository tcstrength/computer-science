My name is Le Thi Tuong Vy, ID number 323, 20 years old, born in my homeland Quang Ngai, a land known as the "sugar cane country," and grew up in the nostalgic city of Can Tho. Perhaps that's why I carry within me the resilient bloodline of the people of Quang Ngai and an honest soul, imbued with the essence of the fertile Mekong Delta.
